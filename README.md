The Summary: Abundant Gardens is a dynamic website and mobile application to connect CalFresh households in San Diego with free food resources from participating restaurants throughout the county. The application allows partnered restaurants to add surplus food resources to a "food queue" that verified CalFresh households can pick up within a specified time block. Once entered into the queue, households may pick up surplus meals using a unique QR code matched by the restaurant at the time of pick up. The purpose of the application is to help aleviate food waste while simultaneously supporting the San Diego Live Well model to promote thriving households in the area.

The Pitch: Food, the paradox! We all need it, we all love it, but we don't all have access to it, and we also waste it! The USDA estimates that about 1lb of food per person in the United States is wasted each day. Yet, over 40 million families in the United States are unable to put dinner on the table. Counties, like San Diego, who implement federal SNAP programs (food stamps) often partner with local businesses and food banks to help supplement food resources for low-income families and individuals. Abundant Gardens aims to provide an interface for CalFresh (CF) customers to easily access surplus meals from participating Live Well County Partner restaurants. The purpose is to bridge the ever growing divide between food scarcity and food waste in our communities.

The Household Journey: An existing CF customer can log into their profile which is linked to a unique case number assigned at the initial eligibility determination for the SNAP program. Households can then find a GPS map of all participating restaurants in the county. Each household will be assigned a personalized QR code to track their usage and confirm pick ups of resources.

The Live Well Partner Journey: Restaurants can log how much food (lbs) they have at the end of the day. Partners can also post pick up windows after business hours that will queue households by QR. Restaurants will be organized by a star rating system:

Food Quality
Live Well rating
Amount of times they donated food instead of throwing it out
Total amount (lbs) of food donated
User reviews/ratings
Core Functionalities:

Ability to login as household or partner
GPS locator
QR access code/tracker
Partner ability to open/close pickup windows and initiate "food queue"
Ratings filter

Add food banks
Restaurants can place themselves in a category when they sign up (Mexican cuisine, Asian Fusion, BBQ, TexMex, American cuisine, etc.) so that the households can input food preferences and be matched accordingly.
Users are able to input allergies/food restrictions
Users can leave a review that evaluates ease of pickup, satisfaction with food provided, and maybe even tips for other families picking up from this location -Mobile App component
